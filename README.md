- This dataset is based on voice measures in frequency. 
- It was produced and released by the University of Oxford, available in the UCI ML Repository.Â 
- The dataset consists of 22 features and 1 result column of the diagnosis. 
- There are a total of 195 rows. Moreover, the dataset has been created from a measure of dysphonia and pitch period entropy.

- Check for null values and missing values.
- Check for all the duplicates present in the dataset and remove them if present.
